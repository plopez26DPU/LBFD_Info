Firefighter I covers basic skills like fire behavior, equipment use, and search and rescue. Firefighter II builds on this with more advanced topics such as incident command and hazardous materials.

# Typical Topics

1. [Fire Behavior and Combustion](#fire-behavior-and-combustion):
   * Understanding the science behind how fires start, the conditions that influence their behavior, and the different stages of combustion.

2. [Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)](#personal-protective-equipment-ppe):
   * Learning about the various components of firefighter PPE, including turnout gear, helmets, gloves, and boots. Emphasizes proper donning and doffing procedures.

3. [Fire Extinguishers and Hose Work](#fire-extinguishers-and-hose-work):
   * Familiarization with different types of fire extinguishers and their appropriate use. Training on handling hoses, nozzle operation, and basic water supply techniques.

4. [Search and Rescue](#search-and-rescue):
   * Techniques for systematic and efficient searching of structures to locate and evacuate victims. Emphasis on safety and communication during rescue operations.

5. [Forcible Entry](#forcible-entry):
   * Methods for gaining entry into buildings quickly and safely, including the use of tools like axes and Halligan bars. Focus on assessing entry points and choosing the most effective approach.

6. [Ladders](#forcible-entry):
   * Understanding and using various types of ladders for accessing different parts of buildings. Training on ladder placement, climbing, and rescue operations involving ladders.

7. [Ventilation](#ventilation):
   * Learning strategies for controlling smoke and heat within a structure to improve visibility and conditions for firefighting. Includes natural and mechanical ventilation techniques.

8. [Water Supply](#water-supply):
   * Understanding the importance of a reliable water supply for firefighting operations. Training on identifying water sources, establishing supply lines, and maintaining water flow during firefighting.

9. [Ropes and Knots](#ropes-and-knots):
   * Basic introduction to ropes, knots, and their applications in firefighting. Focus on tying and using knots for tasks such as hoisting equipment and securing objects.

10. [Fire Prevention and Code Enforcement](#fire-prevention-and-code-enforcement):
    * Studying fire prevention measures and understanding building codes. Emphasis on educating the community about fire safety and enforcing regulations to minimize fire risks.

## Science Behind Fires 

The science behind fires involves the combustion process, which requires three key elements known as the **`"fire triangle": fuel, heat, and oxygen`**.

1. Fuel:
   * `Fuel` is any material that can undergo combustion. This can include solids, liquids, or gases. Different fuels have varying combustion characteristics.

2. Heat:
   * `Heat` is the energy needed to raise the temperature of the fuel to its ignition point. This energy can come from various sources, such as an open flame, electrical spark, or intense heat from nearby sources.

3. Oxygen:
   * `Oxygen` is the oxidizing agent that sustains combustion. It combines with the fuel in a chemical reaction, producing heat and other byproducts.

## Conditions

The conditions influencing fire behavior include:

* `Ventilation`:
  * The availability and movement of air can significantly impact fire behavior. Proper ventilation can influence the direction and intensity of a fire.

* `Confinement`:
  * The space in which a fire occurs can affect its behavior. Confined spaces may lead to increased heat and faster spread, while open spaces allow for better dissipation of heat.

* `Fuel Characteristics`:
  * Different fuels have distinct combustion properties, influencing factors like flame color, temperature, and the speed of combustion.

* `Heat Transfer`:
  * The transfer of heat between objects in close proximity can affect fire behavior. Radiant heat, conduction, and convection play roles in spreading or containing a fire.

## Stages of Combustion

1. Ignition:
   * The beginning of the combustion process where the fuel reaches its ignition temperature and combines with oxygen to produce a flame.

2. Combustion or Growth:
   * The sustained burning of fuel, characterized by the release of heat, light, and the production of combustion byproducts. The fire grows during this stage.

3. Decay or Extinction:
   * The reduction of fuel or oxygen leads to a decline in the fire's intensity. If either of the three elements of the fire triangle is removed, the fire will eventually extinguish.
