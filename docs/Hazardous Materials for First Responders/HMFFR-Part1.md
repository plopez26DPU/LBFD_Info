* `Chronic health effects` - long-term health effects resulting from exposure to a hazardous substance.

## Chapter 1 Notes

A `hazardous materials / WMD incident` is an emergency involving a substance that poses an unreasonable risk to people, the environment, and / or property.

There are several potential causes of these events:
* human error
* mechanical breakdowns / malfunctions
* container failures
* transportation accidents
* deliberate acts
  * chemical suicides
  * WMD incidents

In part, your role is established in government laws that set forth the training requirements and response limitations imposed on personnel responding to these emergencies.

NFPA `1072` and `472` identify three training levels in this manual
* awareness
* operations
* operations mission-specific

### Training levels

`Awareness level` responders are at the incident when it occurs, perform limited defensive actions, such as calling for help, evacuating the hazard area, and securing the scene.

`Operations level` responders are dispatched to the scene in order to `mitigate` the incident. These responders may include firefighters, law enforcement, industrial response personnel, or others. At this level of training personnel are allowed to perform defensive actions, but, with some exceptions they are **NOT** expected to come into direct contact with the hazardous material. 

`Operations Mission-Specific level` responders are typically trained beyond the set of core competencies to perform additional defensive tasks and limited offensive actions. This would include using specialized equipment and performing tasks where they might come into contact with the hazardous material(s).

`APIE` steps:
1. `A`nalyze the incident - attempt to understand the current situation. 
   * What hazardous material was involved?
   * What kind of containers were used?
   * What quantity of the material are we working with?
   * What are the number of exposures?
   * What are the potential hazards? 
2. `P`lan the initial response - use information gathered during analysis phase and determine what actions to take to `mitigate` the incident. The `IC` will issue assignments to responders at this stage.
3. `I`mplement the response - perform the tasks determined during the planning stage. Responder direct actions are `mitigating` the incident.
4. `E`valuate progress - this continues until the termination of the incident response, monitor the progress to see whether the response plan is working. Responders should report the response plan is working, and if they notice any changes in the conditions.

`Q: Do we have our own procedures and appropriate actions for specific levels of training?`

#### `Awareness level`
   
May be first to arrive or witness a hazmat incident, expected to:
* recognize the overall hazmat that is present
* protect themselves and others
* communicate information to appropriate authority
* call for appropriate assistance
* establish scene control by isolating the area
* exercise `situational awareness`

There are many clues that can help `Awareness personnel` recognize the incident and what materials are involved such as,
* the location
* a container's shape
* transportation or facility markings
* metering devices
* odors, taste, or appearance

* `Awareness personnel` are **NOT** responsible for planning the response to a hazmat incident or evaluating the progress of the incident. 
* `SOPs` may provide `awareness personnel` with initial actions they should take in the event of an emergency.

* `Awareness personnel` responsibilities : `TPI`
* `T` - transmit
* `P` - protect
* `I` - Isolate

#### `Operations level`

Respond to hazmat releases and are expected to protect individuals, the environment, and surrounding property in a defensive manner. 

At this level responsibilities include the `awareness level`, and additionally are expected to:
* identify potential hazards involved in the incident
* identify response options
* implement a planned response to mitigate or control a release from a safe distance
* assign tasks to lessen harmful incidents and keep from spreading
* evaluate the progress of the actions taken

While mainly defensive approaches are taken at this level, OSHA does allow `operations level` personnel to take offensive actions involving flammable liquids and gas fire control, such as:
* gasoline
* diesel
* natural gas
* Liquefied petroleum has (LPG)

`Operations level` responders are expected to identify potential hazards at incidents such as:
* type of container involved
* type of hazardous material involved
* hazards presented by the material
* potential behavior of the material

* `Operations level` responders are expected to identify response options for hazmat incidents. They are not responsible for planning the actual response, they must understand the tasks that they might be asked to complete and why they are being completed. 
* `Operations level` responders must be aware of safety precautions, the available PPE, and the emergency decontamination needs. 

`Operations level` responders are expected to establish the incident management system, establish scene control, and implement protective actions such as:
* follow safety procedures
* use PPE in proper manner
* avoid hazards, and complete their assignments
* perform emergency decontamination
* identify and preserve potential evidence

`Operations level` responders are expected to evaluate the progress of their assigned tasks and must be able to report this information to the appropriate authority so the action plan can be adjusted if needed.

#### `Operations Mission-Specific level`

* `Operations Mission-Specific level` personnel may be trained to perform mission-specific tasks which would fit into the `APIE` process. 

Some specific tasks are:
* PPE requirements and usage
* mass decontamination
* technical decontamination
* evidence preservation and sampling
* product control
* air monitoring and sampling
* victim rescue and recovery
* response to illicit lab results

### Hazmat Dangers

Hazardous materials / WMD can hurt you in different manners. They may affect your health if they contact or get into your body, or may cause harm by their behavior and / or physical properties, examples being if they can burn or explode. 

To safely mitigate hazmat incidents, you should understand the variety of materials you may encounter, the health effects, and the physical `hazards` associated.
