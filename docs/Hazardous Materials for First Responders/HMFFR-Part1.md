# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Hazardous Materials

## Objectives
* Define a hazardous materials incident.
* Describe roles and responsibilities of first responders in hazardous materials incidents.
* Recognize ways that hazardous materials harm people.
* List hazardous materials regulations, definitions, and statistics.

## Things To Think About While Reading
* What is a hazardous materials (hazmat) incident? 
* How does a hazmat incident happen?
* What do we do during a hazmat incident?
* Who is typically involved while responding to a hazmat incident? 
* Why is a hazmat incident dangerous?
* What are some hazmat regulations?

## Key Terms
* `Hazardous Materials (hazmat)` - any substance or material that poses an unreasonable risk to health, safety, property, and / or the environment. 
* `Dangerous Goods` - alternate term used in Canada and other countries for hazardous materials. 
* `Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)` - any weapon or device that is intended or has the capability to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant amount of people.
* `CBRNE` - chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive
* `Mitigate` - to cause to become less harsh or hostile; to make less severe, intense or painful; to alleviate. The third of three steps (locate, isolate, mitigate) in one method of sizing up an emergency situation.
* `SOP` - standard operating procedure
* `SOG` - standard operating guideline
* `National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)` - U.S. nonprofit educational and technical association devoted to protecting life and property from fire by developing fire protection standards and educating the public. 
* `Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)` - an organization, office, or individual responsible for enforcing the requirements of a code or standard, or approving equipment, materials, an installation, or a procedure.
* `Awareness level` - lowest level of training established by the NFPA for personnel at hazmat incidents.
* `Operations level` - level of training established by the NFPA allowing first responders to take defensive actions at hazmat incidents.
* `Operations Mission-Specific Level` - level of training established by the NFPA allowing first responders to take additional defensive tasks and limited offensive actions at hazmat incidents.

## Notes

A `hazardous materials / WMD incident` is an emergency involving a substance that poses an unreasonable risk to people, the environment, and / or property.

There are several potential causes of these events:
* human error
* mechanical breakdowns / malfunctions
* container failures
* transportation accidents
* deliberate acts
  * chemical suicides
  * WMD incidents

In part, your role is established in government laws that set forth the training requirements and response limitations imposed on personnel responding to these emergencies.

NFPA `1072` and `472` identify three training levels in this manual
* awareness
* operations
* operations mission-specific

`Awareness level` responders are at the incident when it occurs, perform limited defensive actions, such as calling for help, evacuating the hazard area, and securing the scene.

`Operations level` responders are dispatched to the scene in order to `mitigate` the incident. These responders may include firefighters, law enforcement, industrial response personnel, or others. At this level of training personnel are allowed to perform defensive actions, but, with some exceptions they are **NOT** expected to come into direct contact with the hazardous material. 

`Operations Mission-Specific level` responders are typically trained beyond the set of core competencies to perform additional defensive tasks and limited offensive actions. This would include using specialized equipment and performing tasks where they might come into contact with the hazardous material(s).
