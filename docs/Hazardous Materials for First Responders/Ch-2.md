# Learning Objective 1 - Restate the seven clues to the presence of hazardous materials.

moving closer to a hazardous material increases risk. 

seven clues to the presence of hazmat materials
1. occupancy types, locations pre-incident surveys 
2. container shapes
3. transportation placards, labels, and markings
4. other markings and colors (non-transportation)
5. written resources
6. senses
7. monitoring and detection devices

mixed loads in transportation may not be marked at all.

# Learning Objective 2 - Explain how pre-incident plans, occupancy types, and locations may indicate the presence of hazardous materials.

pre-incident plans simplify and reduce on-site decisions and identify:
* exposures
* hazmat types, quantities, dangers, locations
* building features such as location of fire suppression systems
* site characteristics
* possible access / egress difficulties
* inherent limitations of response organizations when trying to control certain types of hazmat emergencies
* 24-hour telephone numbers of responsible parties and site experts
* site or occupancy response capability

* certain occupancies are likely to have hazardous materials.
* feed / farm stores are likely to have hazardous materials in stock. 
* the presence of fume hood exhaust stacks indicates a laboratory
* residential occupancies have many hazardous chemicals.

hazmat accidents are more likely to occur during transfer or handling, such as:
* ports
* docks or piers
* railroad sidings
* airplane hangars
* truck terminals

* port facilities, railway bridges and trestles are likely spots for hazmat incidents.
* hazardous materials may be released during flooding.

* Q: What types of occupancies are most likely to have hazardous materials?
* A: 

# Learning Objective 3 - Identify basic container shapes that indicate the presence and hazards of hazardous materials.

* hazmat containers are sometimes classified by transport mode, such as:
  * highway
  * rail
  * water
  * multiple modes

* containers can also be classified by capacity, such as:
  * bulk: loaded with no intermediate form of containment, and includes:
    * cargo tanks
    * railcars
    * portable tanks
    * intermediate bulk containers (ICB)
    * intermodal containers (IM)
  * non-bulk


* bulk packaging criteria is by volume, mass, or weight.
  * liquid: 
    * maximum capacity > 119 gallons (475 L)
  * Solid: 
    * maximum capacity > 882 pounds (440 kg)
    * maximum capacity > 119 gallons (475 L)
  * Gas:
    * capacity >= 1,001 pounds (500 kg)

* non-bulk packaging is smaller than the criteria for bulk packaging and have some type of intermediate containment, such as:
  * drums
  * boxes
  * carboys
  * bags
  * composite packages
  * combination packages

* Pressure containers:
  * Compressed gas cylinders are a familiar type of pressure container. 
  * Pressure containers can rupture violently due to internal pressure. 
  * Pressurized gas will expand rapidly if released into the environment.
  * When damaged or stressed by heat or flames, may explode. Keep distance!
  * Contents can ignite easily and will expand quickly if released. 
    * Keep distance upwind, uphill, and upstream.
    * Remove ignition source if it can be done safely.
  * Contents may be extremely toxic.
  * Contents may be corrosive.
  * May have:
    * rounded, spherical ends or bolted manways.
    * bolted protective housings. 
    * pressure relief devices. 
    * pressure gauges
  * Containers may vary: 
    * fixed facility (bulk)
    * railway tank car
    * highway cargo tank
    * compressed gas tube-trailer
    * intermodal
    * ton container
    * y-cylinders
    * compressed gas cylinders
    * portable propane cylinders
    * vehicle mounted

* Cryogenic containers:
  * store and transport cryogens
    * sometimes called refrigerated liquefied gas
    * gas that turns into a liquid
      * at or below -130 F.
      * at 14.7 PSI
  * may change rapidly from a liquid to a vapor when released
    * vapor clouds may be flammable, toxic, corrosive, or an oxidizer 
    * vapors may be extremely cold, potentially causing freezing burns
  * can displace oxygen and cause asphyxiation 
  * are extremely cold and can severely injure you if contacted
    * immediately remove any clothing saturated with cryogenic material.
  * contents are a clue, and can include:
    * liquid oxygen (LOX)
    * nitrogen 
    * helium
    * hydrogen
    * argon
    * liquefied natural gas (LNG)
  * box-like loading and unloading stations attached to transportation containers
  * containers vary:
    * fixed facility (bulk)
    * railway tank car
    * highway cargo tank
    * intermodal
    * cylinder
    * dewar flask

* Liquid containers:
  * many different types, such as:
    * bottles
    * gasoline containers
    * paint pails
    * drums
    * fixed facility containers
  * may hold contents that have different hazards, such as:
    * pressure
    * heat
    * reactivity
    * corrosivity
    * toxicity
  * may explode when damaged or stressed
  * will have low amounts of pressure, but when released this pressure may cause contents to spray or splash
  * clues for liquid containers:
    * flat (or less rounded) ends on tanks
    * access hatches secured with removable latching devices
    * low pressure rail tank cars may have multiple visible fittings
    * flexible intermediate bulk containers that can be stacked
    * flexible bladders filled with fluids
    * upside-down horseshoe-shaped or circular-shaped ends with less rounding than pressure tanks

* Solids containers:
  * may be:
    * toxic or corrosive
    * release energy
    * be reactive
    * engulf, suffocate, or crush
    * airborne particles may explode
  * have systems designed for pneumatic loading and unloading
  * have open tops or be covered with tarps or plastic
  * dust explosions can kill you!
  * solid materials can engulf and kill you!
