# Learning Objective 1
* Define a hazardous materials incident. 
    * `an emergency involving substances that pose unreasonable risk to people, the environment and property.`

* hazardous materials are substances that possess harmful characteristics. 
  * US: hazardous materials
  * Canada: Dangerous goods

* WMD = weapons of mass destruction
  * have the potential to cause mass casualties and damage
  * CBRNE
    * chemical
    * biological
    * radiological
    * nuclear
    * explosive

* hazmat incidents have many potential causes and are often more complex than other types of incidents.
  * are not always clearly defined before first responders arrive.


Q: `How are hazardous materials incidents different from other types of emergency incidents? `
A: `They pose different risks that we normally do not need to think about. The incident will need to be handled differently because of the said additional risks.`

# Learning Objective 2
* Describe roles and responsibilities of first responders in hazardous materials incidents.

* First responder roles are established by law and NFPA standards. 
  * NFPA 1072 <- meets or exceed OSHA requirements for awareness operation, and technician
  * NFPA 472
  * NFPA 473

* Three levels addressed:
  1. Awareness: perform limited defensive actions
  2. Operations: perform defensive actions
  3. Mission-specific: trained to perform additional defensive and limited offensive actions

* APIE helps responders devise a 4-step response for any hazmat incident:
  * Analyze
  * Plan
  * Implement
  * Evaluate

* as your responsibilities increase the components of APIE increase

* Awareness level personnel 
  * might be first to arrive on scene
  * responsibilities include transmit, protect, and isolate
  * be aware of clues to assist in recognizing presence of hazardous materials, such as:
    * location
    * container shape
    * transportation or facility markings
    * metering devices
    * sensory input such as odor, taste, appearance
  * not responsible for planning the response to an incident, additional actions may be dictated by:
    * SOPs/SOGs 
    * predetermined procedures
  * play an important role at an incident
    * initial actions can affect course of incident
    * transmission of information
    * call for assistance
    * initiate protective actions
    * isolate area

* Operations level personnel
  * respond to hazmat releases as part of their normal duties.
  * must be able to:
    * identify potential hazards
      * type of container involved
      * hazardous materials involved
      * hazards presented
      * potential behavior
    * identify response options
    * implement planned response 
    * evaluate progress of incident actions
    * determine where the release has occurred
    * identify response options
    * understand tasks they may need to assign
    * protect themselves
  * do not plan the actual response
  * are expected to:
    * establish incident management system
    * establish scene control
    * implement protective actions
    * follow procedures
    * complete assignments
    * perform emergency decontamination
    * identify and preserve potential evidence
  * may be trained beyond core competencies 
    * mission-specific specialized competencies, such as:
      * PPE (may include use of specialized PPE)
      * mass decon
      * technical decon
      * evidence preservation and sampling
      * product control
      * air monitoring and sampling
      * victim rescue and recovery
      * respond to illicit lab incidents

Q: `What are the three levels of hazmat responders and what are their responsibilities?`
A:
1. `Awareness` - `transmit information, protect and isolate the area.`
2. `Operations` - `identify potential hazards, implement the planned response, evaluate progress of incident, establish incident management system`
3. `Operations - Mission-Specific` - `preserve evidence, monitoring and sampling, rescue victims`

# Learning Objective 3
* Recognize the ways that hazardous materials harm people. 

* may affect health if contact has been made or get into your body
* may cause harm by their behavior and/ or physical properties

* materials may have potential health effects, and can be:
  * acute
  * chronic
  * delayed

* hazardous materials can enter the body in several manners:
  * inhalation
    * the most common exposure
    * breathing materials in through your nose or mouth
  * absorption
    * poor hygiene can lead to accidental ingestion
    * eating or swallowing materials through your mouth
  * ingestion
    * some materials pass through skin and mucous membranes
    * taking in materials through your skin or eyes
  * injection
    * sharp objects can cut or puncture skin
    * taking in materials through a puncture in the skin

* materials can harm you in three ways:
  1.  energy release
      * present the greatest threat
      * have different types, such as:
        * heat - fire, explosions, burns, extreme temperatures even lack of heat (cryogenic liquids and gases)
        * mechanical - possess energy due to position or motion. flying or falling objects, abrasions, blisters, burns (friction)
        * pressure - release materials violently
        * electricity - utilities, energized containers, electrical equipment
        * chemical - flames or explosions, release heat, chemical reactions that create new hazards
        * radiation - exposure potential, medical centers, industrial operations, nuclear power plants, terrorist attacks
  2.  corrosives - chemicals that burn or destroy living tissue
      * contact with skin or body
      * can damage tools and equipment 
  3.  toxicity
    * cause damage on a molecular scale
    * can be fast-acting, acute, chronic, or not manifested for many years

Q: `What are the four main routes of entry through which hazardous materials can enter the body and cause harm?`
A: `inhalation, absorption, ingestion and injection` 

Q: `What are the three main mechanisms by which hazardous materials can cause bodily harm?`
A: `energy release, corrosive and toxicity`

# Learning Objective 4
* List hazardous materials regulations, definitions, and statistics.

* ammonium nitrate ship exploded at a dock and 3,000 people were injured and 500 people were killed

* four main US federal agencies are involved in hazmat regulations
  * Department of Transportation (DOT)
    * issues transportation regulations
    * changed placard regulations after unmarked trailer contained 50,000 lbs of ammonium nitration explosion in Kansas City
      * killed six firefighters
  * Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    * sets national standards for environmental programs
    * Love canal health problems led to passage of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
  * Department of Labor (DOL)
    * regulate worker safety, hazardous household products, and radioactive materials
      * OSHA - occupational safety and health administration; worker safety
      * CPSC - consumer product safety commission; hazardous household products
  * Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
    * radioactive materials
    * use, storage, and transfer

* Four main Canadian agencies:
  * Transport Canada (TC)
  * Environment Canada
  * Health Canada
  * Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)

* Three main Mexican agencies:
  * SCT
  * SEMARNAT
  * STPS

* all first responders will likely have to deal with a hazmat incident
* transportation hazmat incidents are common
  * most occur while materials are being transported by highway

Q: `Why are there so many regulations involving hazardous materials?`
A: `There have been historical deaths and incidents that have created and caused these different regulations to be put into place.`
